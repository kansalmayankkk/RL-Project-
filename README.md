Breakout-Genius
In this project, we did the basics of ML and DL, implement CNN and RL on simple environment, develop a deep RL model to play Breakout game, experiment with hyperparameters and architectures.

step 1	Installing dependencies and Jupyter notebook, and learning basics of ML, Deep Learning.

step 2	Learning CNN and implementing it with Pytorch.

step 3	Learning concepts of Reinforcement learning.

step 4	Implementation and training of deep RL model.
